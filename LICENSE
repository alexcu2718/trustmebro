Terms and Conditions
1. You can do whatever you want with this code.

I trust you, bro. If you break it, well, that’s on you. Just don’t come crying to me when it explodes your computer or starts a rogue AI uprising. I’m not liable.
2. Use it at your own risk.

This software may or may not do what you expect it to do. It could be incredibly dangerous, or it could make you rich and famous. Honestly, who knows? I certainly don’t. Just know that if it breaks anything, it’s your fault.
3. No warranties.

This software is provided "as-is," with no warranties whatsoever. If you trust this software with your data, your system, or your soul—good luck. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you.
4. Modify it as you wish.

If you want to change this code, go ahead. But remember, you’re now taking on the full responsibility of any disaster that might occur. I don’t want to hear about your broken projects or ruined weekend.
5. Liability is on you.

If this code causes any problems—whether it’s destroying data, causing hardware failure, making your pet hamster run away, or summoning a demon from the depths of the internet—you are responsible. Not me.
6. Permission to use, modify, and distribute.

I trust you enough to let you use, modify, and distribute this code. But if you make a ton of money from it, remember to buy me a drink next time you’re in town. Or don’t. I trust you either way.
7. Attribution (optional, but cool).

It’s not required, but if you use this code and it does anything remotely awesome, maybe send a tweet saying "Thanks, bro" or something. It’s always nice to get some recognition for the chaos you’ve helped to create.
8. No refunds.

This software is free, but if it ruins your entire weekend, there will be no compensation. Absolutely none. Seriously, I’ll just laugh and walk away.
Summary

By using this software, you are agreeing to trust me, bro. You are choosing to live on the edge, taking a wild ride of uncertainty. If it crashes, it’s on you. If it succeeds, well, I’m just as surprised as you. But either way, we’re in this together, right?
